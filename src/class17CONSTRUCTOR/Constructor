Constructors:

C help us give initial values to the fields of a class.

Why we should use a constructor:
 C help us write cleaner code.
 C. give us more control over the values that an end user can assign to the field of a class.

 Syntax of C:
    Access modifier className (parameters){
    }
    Class Dog{
    String name;
    public Dog (String dogName){
    name=dogName;
    }

    WHta is the role of c. - initialise the object.
