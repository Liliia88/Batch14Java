What is inheritance:
iTS MECHANISM THROUGH which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class.

Why we should learn I:
-it helps use avoid dublication
-it helps us save space
it helps us improve the execution speed

What is the syntax?
 We use the extends keyword and the name of the class from which we want to inherit
  the fields and methods while declaring the class.

  Types of I:
  4 types of I. but Java only supports 3 of them with classes.
  1) single
  2) multilevel
  3)hierarchical
  4) multiple (it is not supported by classes in java).
  Single I.
      When we have only parent and one child in I. ,NOT WIDELY USED.
  Multilevel I.
     One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes. For Example A<B<C<D.
  Hierarchical.
     When we have one parent and multiple child classes.
  Multilevel:
One child and multiple parent classes. It is not supported by classes in java. it creates the diamond problem.

Super keyword:
We use the super keyword to explicitly call the variable from the parent class. When we have same name instance variable
in child class and parent class.
We can also use the super keyword to call the constructor of the parent class.

MethodOverloading:
-it allows us to create multiple methods in the class with the same name.with different parameters.
  Why we should create multiple methods with the same name?
  It gives the end user flexibility.
  The end user can call the same method with different parameters to get same or different results.
How do we overload a method?
  1) By passing different number of parameters.
  2) By changing the datatype.
  3) By changing the sequence of parameters.
Syntax?
  create different methods but keep the following points in mind.
  1)we can overload a method by just passing different number of parameter.
  2)we can overload a methd by changing the data type of parameter
  3)
