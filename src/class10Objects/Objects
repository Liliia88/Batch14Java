What is an object?
everything around us in an object for example keaboard, mouse, glass, etc.
O. can be defined based on how they look and how they behave.
O. in computer programming are also very similar. They have state (which helps us define how that o. 
look like) and behaviors (what that o. does)

What is Class:
Class is blueprint/design/template from which we create the objects.



Object oriented programming:

Is just a way of writing programs.
Why we should learn OOP?

1.It simplify the development of large programs.
2. it will also helps us maintain and modify the existing code.
3. it helps use write more secure code.
4. it helps us avoid duplicate code.

What is the syntax?


OOP HAS 4 MAIN PILLARS.
1. Classes and objects
2. Inheritance
3.Polymorphism
4. Abstraction
5. Encapsulation

Classes and Objects?
A class is a template/Blueprint from which we create the objects.
An object in programming is very similar to the o that we have in real life.

Objects:

O. have states

  String class:
String is the most widely used class in java. It helps us store and manipulate Text based data.
  Why we should learn about String class and its methods.
  
String class has a lot of methods that can help us manipulate the text based data.
That's why we don't need to write any logic we can simple create the object of the string
class and can use the method from that class.
  Syntax:
  String str=new String ("I can't sleep if I don't solve Repls");
  String str2="I can't sleep if I don't solve Repls";
  str2.length();
