  Arrays:
  A are consecutive memory locations which store same type of data.
  
  Why we need arrays?
  A help us to store large amounts of data in single variable. 
  For example, if we want to store the names of 100 students we don't need to 
  create 100 variables we can simple create an array of size 100 and it will
  store the names.
