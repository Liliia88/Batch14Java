"this" keyword:
   this is a keyword like class, void. it is used in many places. Foe example if we have same name instance
   and a local variable we can use "this" to explicitly refer to instance variable.
We can use "this()" to call a constructor inside another constructor.
Why should we learn about "this"
   -it allows us to have same name local and instance variables.
   -if we have same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor inside another constructor
   by writing "this()".

Inheritance:
   I. is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside another class.
There are 4 types of inheritance.
   1) single inheritance. - we have only one parent and one child class.
   Employee->Person.
   2) Multilevel inheritance:
     In M.I. we have i. in multiple levels like we have a grandfather->father->son->grand son
   3) Hierarchical inheritance:
     one parent class and multiple direct child classes.
   4) Multiple inheritance:
      one child class can directly inherit from multiple parent classes. it is not supported by java because of
      diamond problem.

Why should we learn inheritance?
   It allows to reduce the dublicate the code.
What is the syntax?
   We can use this feature by writing extends keyword when declaring a class.

   private members and Constructors are not inherited.
