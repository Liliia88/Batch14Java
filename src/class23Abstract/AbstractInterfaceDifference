if you don't want to implement any method, you should just write abstract method (abstract void..)

Abstract class definitions should not be made as final because abstract classes always participate
in inheritance classes.

If we want to implement SOME methods: we should use abstract
but if use ALL methods : use interface.


Abstract class:
-any variable (static, instance)
-have constructor
-can have implemented and inimplemented methods
-methods can have any accessibility (not only public)

Interface 100% abstraction
-only public static final variables
-no constructor
-public abstract methods ONLY UNimplemented

since java 8- partial abstraction
 -we can have implemented methods (only static and only default)
