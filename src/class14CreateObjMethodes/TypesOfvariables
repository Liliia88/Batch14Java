Types of variables with respect to their scope:
There are 3 types of variables w.r.t. their scope.
1) local variables.
2) instance variables.
3) static variables.

Local variables:
A variable that is created inside a method loop switch case or any block of code is called local variable.
-When we should use loval variables:
 Local V occupy the computers memory for the shortest amount of time.
 We should always go with local v if it is possible.
 But they are limited in scope we can't use local v outside of that block in which they are declared.

void bark() {
        int i = 4; //local
        for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            System.out.println("Barking..");
        }
    }
    Their scope is very limited, only inside that block in which they are created. we can't access them outside that
     block.


   Instance variables:
       Which are declared outside a black of code but inside a class are called instance variables.
   When we should use IV:
       When we should use I.V.:
                 1) when we need to share a value between 2 or more methods then we should go with i.v.
                 2) When we are planning to create multiple objects of a class and it is possible that all the objects can have a different
                 VALUE for that variablE
   They occupy the memory for longer as compared to local v.
    We can use these v. inside any block of code that is inside that class.

    STATIC variables:
              If an instance variable has a keyword static is called a static variable.
          When we should use S.V.:
          When we need to share something
     STATIC VARIABLE:
              An instance v. with static keyword is called a static variable.
              They occupy the memory for the longest period.
              When to use:
          When we want ot share something across all the methods.
We can share data across the objects with the help of static variables.
